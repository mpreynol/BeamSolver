## Beam Solver is a Linear Beam Solver Written for Excel
The program involves an input sheet for a user to input key beam parameters. Following this the user pushes the 'Run' button to launch a Visual Basic Script.

The unique feature about this script is that the members are autogenerated around important nodes based on the base resolution. This provides a smooth output of results.
### Modules:
Module 1: Script that runs the algorithm

Module 2: Scripts that define objects

Module 3: Math scripts

Module 4: Output scripts

### Classes:
Member: Class defines the stiffness matrix and geometry for each member

Node: Class defines the geometry of a node
